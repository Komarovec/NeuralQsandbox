    performance penalty as the collision information is recalculated.
    There is no penalty for having multiple static bodies, and it can be

        """Create a new Body

        Mass and moment are ignored when body_type is KINEMATIC or STATIC.

        Guessing the mass for a body is usually fine, but guessing a moment
        of inertia can lead to a very poor simulation so it's recommended to
        use Chipmunk's moment calculations to estimate the moment for you.

        There are two ways to set up a dynamic body. The easiest option is to
        create a body with a mass and moment of 0, and set the mass or
        density of each collision shape added to the body. Chipmunk will
        automatically calculate the mass, moment of inertia, and center of
        gravity for you. This is probably preferred in most cases. Note that 
        these will only be correctly calculated after the body and shape are 
        added to a space.

        The other option is to set the mass of the body when it's created,
        and leave the mass of the shapes added to it as 0.0. This approach is
        more flexible, but is not as easy to use. Don't set the mass of both
        the body and the shapes. If you do so, it will recalculate and
        overwrite your custom mass value when the shapes are added to the body.

        Examples of the different ways to set up the mass and moment:

        >>> import pymunk
        >>> radius = 2
        >>> mass = 3
        >>> density = 3
        >>> def print_mass_moment(b): 
        ...    print("mass={:.0f} moment={:.0f}".format(b.mass, b.moment))
        
        >>> # Using Shape.density
        >>> s = pymunk.Space()
        >>> b = pymunk.Body()
        >>> c = pymunk.Circle(b, radius)
        >>> c.density = density
        >>> print_mass_moment(b)
        mass=0 moment=0
        >>> s.add(b, c)
        >>> print_mass_moment(b)
        mass=38 moment=75

        >>> # Using Shape.mass
        >>> b = pymunk.Body()
        >>> c = pymunk.Circle(b, radius)
        >>> c.mass = mass
        >>> print_mass_moment(b)
        mass=0 moment=0
        >>> s.add(b, c)
        >>> print_mass_moment(b)
        mass=3 moment=6

        >>> # Using Body constructor
        >>> moment = pymunk.moment_for_circle(mass, 0, radius)
        >>> b = pymunk.Body()
        >>> c = pymunk.Circle(b, radius)
        >>> c.mass = mass
        >>> print_mass_moment(b)
        mass=0 moment=0
        >>> s.add(b, c)
        >>> print_mass_moment(b)
        mass=3 moment=6

        It becomes even more useful to use the mass or density properties of 
        the shape when you attach multiple shapes to one body, like in this 
        example with density:

        >>> # Using multiple Shape.density
        >>> b = pymunk.Body()
        >>> c1 = pymunk.Circle(b, radius, offset=(10,0))
        >>> c1.density = density
        >>> c2 = pymunk.Circle(b, radius, offset=(0,10))
        >>> c2.density = density
        >>> s.add(b, c1, c2)
        >>> print_mass_moment(b)
        mass=75 moment=3921
