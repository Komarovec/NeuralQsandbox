NeuralQsandbox is an open-source environment for playing and experimenting with artificial intelligence. <br>
<br>
Create a level and watch agent with artificial brain try to solve it. Modify learning variables and restructure agent's brain, then watch agent's change in behaviour. 

## Installation

### Windows
Download latest release [here](https://github.com/Komarovec/NeuralQsandbox/releases) and simply run *NeuralQsandbox.exe*

### Linux
Create a virtual environment with Python 3.5 (or newer), and with pip install all requirements specified in *requirements_linux.txt*.

```bash
pip install -r requirements_linux.txt
```

This project also uses tkinter. If you don't have it installed already, you can install it by typing:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-tk
```

## Features
